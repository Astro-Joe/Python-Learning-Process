# Python-Learning-Process

A curated collection of Python scripts, examples, and practice exercises created during my journey of learning Python.  
This repository covers a wide spectrum of Python concepts — from basic syntax and data structures to functions, OOP, and practical coding challenges.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **learning_process/**: Practice scripts & coding exercises on lists, dictionaries, functions, and control flow.
    - `list.py`, `Alien.py`, `cars.py`, etc.
- **Functions/**: Learn how to define and use Python functions with docstrings and practical examples.
- **Classes/**: Comprehensive OOP examples including custom classes for cars, users, and more.
    - `class_Car.py`, `class_Dog.py`, `class_Users.py`, `MyElectricCar.py`, `my_car.py`
- **practice/**: Revision scripts and hands-on exercises.

## 📝 Example Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, strings, lists, dictionaries, and control flow.
- **Functions**: Defining, calling, and documenting functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and method overriding.
- **Working With Data**: Manipulating lists, dictionaries, and more.
- **Practice Challenges**: Real-life practice scripts and revision exercises.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- At the root level, you will find the `README.md` file, providing overall documentation and guidance for the repository.

- The `learning_process` directory contains various practice scripts and exercises. For example, you’ll find files like `list.py` for list operations, `Alien.py` for dictionary practice, and `cars.py` for experimenting with functions and arguments.

- The `Functions` directory focuses on defining and using Python functions. For example, `Intro.py` introduces function syntax and usage.

- The `Classes` directory is dedicated to object-oriented programming concepts. Here, you can explore:
    - `class_Car.py` and `MyElectricCar.py` — examples of class creation, inheritance, and method overriding.
    - `class_Dog.py` — a simple class modeling a dog.
    - `class_Users.py` — user and admin class examples.
    - `my_car.py` — practical usage of the car classes.

- The `practice` directory includes additional revision scripts and hands-on exercises, such as `revision.py`, which contains various Python practice routines.

Each directory is focused on a core Python topic—functions, classes, data structures, or practice exercises—making it straightforward to navigate and find examples for different aspects of Python programming.
